# Reputation Data & REP Flag Fix

## Problem Description
User reputation data (ratings, completed projects, earnings) was not being stored correctly in project JSON files, and the REP flag was always `false`. All reputation-related fields showed 0 values:

- `employer_earnings_score`: 0
- `employer_complete_projects`: 0  
- `employer_overall_rating`: 0
- `is_rep`: false

## Root Cause Analysis

### Two Issues Found:

1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The reputation API returns data with user_id as key, but processing code expected direct access
2. **Rate Limiting**: When API calls are rate-limited, fallback data (all zeros) is used without proper logging

### Data Flow Problem:

```javascript
// API Response Structure:
{
  "result": {
    "12345": {  // ← user_id as key
      "earnings_score": 150,
      "entire_history": {
        "complete": 25,
        "overall": 4.8
      }
    }
  }
}

// But prepare_project_data() expected:
user_rep.get('earnings_score', 0)        // ← Direct access
user_rep.get('entire_history', {})       // ← Direct access
```

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Data Extraction in `main()` function:

```python
# BEFORE (broken):
project_data = prepare_project_data(project, project_id, reputation_data['result'], country)

# AFTER (fixed):
# Extract user-specific reputation data from the result
user_rep_data = {}
result = reputation_data['result']
if isinstance(result, dict):
    user_key = str(owner_id)
    if user_key in result:
        user_rep_data = result[user_key]  # Extract user-specific data
        print(f"💰 Retrieved reputation for user {owner_id}: earnings={user_rep_data.get('earnings_score', 0)}")
    else:
        print(f"⚠️ User {owner_id} not found in reputation result")
        user_rep_data = {'earnings_score': 0, 'entire_history': {'complete': 0, 'overall': 0}}

project_data = prepare_project_data(project, project_id, user_rep_data, country)
```

### Improved Rate Limiting Logging:

```python
# Better logging when rate limiting is active
print(f"🚫 Global rate limit active - skipping user reputation API call for user {user_id}")
print(f"⚠️ Using fallback reputation data (all zeros) for user {user_id} due to rate limiting")
```

## How It Works Now

### Complete Reputation Flow:
1. **API Call**: `get_user_reputation(owner_id)` fetches reputation data
2. **Structure Check**: Validates that result contains user_id as key
3. **Data Extraction**: Extracts user-specific data from `result[user_id]`
4. **Processing**: `prepare_project_data()` receives correct structure
5. **REP Flag**: Calculated based on actual ratings and project counts
6. **Storage**: Proper values saved to JSON files

### REP Flag Calculation:
```python
employer_rating = project_data.get('employer_overall_rating', 0)
employer_reviews = project_data.get('employer_complete_projects', 0)
is_rep = (employer_rating >= LIMIT_EMPLOYER_RATING and employer_reviews > LIMIT_EMPLOYER_REVIEWS)
```

Where:
- `LIMIT_EMPLOYER_RATING = 4.0`
- `LIMIT_EMPLOYER_REVIEWS = 1`

## Testing the Fix

### Check Reputation Data:
```bash
# Run the reputation debug script
python test-reputation-debug.py

# Run normal bidding process and check console output
python bidder.py
```

### Verify in JSON Files:
Look for proper reputation values in `jobs/job_*.json`:
```json
{
  "project_details": {
    "employer_earnings_score": 1500,    // ✅ Should be > 0
    "employer_complete_projects": 25,   // ✅ Should be > 0
    "employer_overall_rating": 4.8,     // ✅ Should be > 0
    "flags": {
      "is_rep": true                    // ✅ Should be true if criteria met
    }
  }
}
```

### Console Output to Check:
```
💰 Retrieved reputation for user 12345: earnings=1500, complete=25, rating=4.8
```

## Impact

**Before Fix**: 
- All reputation data was 0
- REP flag always false
- Silent failures in data processing
- Poor project quality assessment

**After Fix**: 
- ✅ Correct reputation data extraction
- ✅ Proper REP flag calculation
- ✅ Better error logging and debugging
- ✅ Accurate project quality assessment
- ✅ Improved rate limiting handling

## Rate Limiting Considerations

When rate limiting is active:
- Reputation API calls are skipped
- Fallback data (zeros) is used
- Clear logging indicates when this happens
- Consider increasing cache expiry to reduce API calls
- Monitor rate limit status in logs

The reputation system now works correctly and provides accurate employer quality assessment for better project filtering!
