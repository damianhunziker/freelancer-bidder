Projects that I bid on:Project Details
$250.00 ‚Äì 750.00 USD

 BIDDING ENDS IN 6 DAYS, 23 HOURS
 This is basically a reposting of a Project originally posted on 16 March. There has been no real change in the scope of the Project itself, this new one just answers some common questions and provides more specific details regarding the Project and my expectations. I do believe I have actually done quite a bit of the analysis and fact-finding required to provide a quote and complete the work. My apologies to those of you who already placed a bid on the Project‚Äôs original listing. Nothing much has changed, this one just has more precise information.  ENVIRONMENT  CURRENT / OLD SITE (Server 1) ‚Ä¢ This is the primary domain (public_html root) on a GoDaddy dedicated server ‚Ä¢ Drupal 8.9.20 installation (active site - core, modules, libraries all installed, upgraded and maintained to date via FTP or Drupal UI) ‚Ä¢ PHP: 7.4 ‚Ä¢ There is a directory/domain (at public_html/x) that has an active WordPress site. Any/all work must bear this in mind to avoid conflicts, etc.   DEV / NEW SITE (Server 2) ‚Ä¢ GoDaddy shared server ‚Ä¢ Drupal 10.4.4 installation (empty - no db, files, or added modules). Project bid winner can decide whether to begin at 10.4.4 (installed here via GoDaddy UI) or troubleshoot modules/ramp up from Current Site‚Äôs 8.9.20. Work should be done via Composer/Drush (see #4 below). ‚Ä¢ PHP: 8.4 ‚Ä¢ This is the desired environment   TASKS NEEDED:  * Clean up database. I am sure there are temp/redundant files, etc. causing bloating of the database (19.6 GB). Not sure when (during completion of Tasks 1-3) would be the best time to do this.  1. Upgrade necessary (i.e. those used in Current Site only) modules for use in Dev Site. I know which modules have been enabled, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they are actually being used. (See Google sheet below). I believe all modules have all been downloaded from Drupal.org. 5-10 modules have patches that were necessary for 8.9.20.  2. Import existing db and files from Current site to Dev site.  3. Ensure upgrade/conversion from Drupal 8.9.20 to 10.4.4 is complete and fully functional (i.e. New Site content, navigation, and operation are equal to that of Old Site.)  4. Participate in a 2 hour Zoom meeting consisting of (1) Review work completed on the above tasks - especially how to avoid db bloating (*) and (2) instruction regarding installation; navigation; operation; and Drupal core / module installation and updating using Composer/Drush application application and commands.  MORE INFORMATION  Information on cPanel, server, disk, PHP, and modules for both Live and Dev sites here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4UAY0jxrRZhJbrsaOxBritjRSKYwT0LE0yWOiRsBWI/edit?gid=173 3652974#gid=1733652974  SITE MAPS Attached are 2 images showing the Current site‚Äôs public_html parent and public_html directories.

Build intermediary software that connects tradingview webhooks to binance api, hosted on my server

Scripting & Automation  Posted Feb 19, 2025
i ALREADY have a tradingview strategy that sends market buy/sell signals via webhooks, so I DO NOT NEED PINESCRIPT CODER OR TRADINGVIEW STRATEGY.   i want intermediary software like 3 commas hosted by me via vps, built in python or node.js.  workflow: i only trade binance futures, only use usdt. from webhook i only receive long/short signal and ticker, entries always happen via market orders.  1. TradingView Webhook: The bot will listen for  buy/sell signals from TradingView via a webhook and execute market orders on Binance using Binance API(USD Futures only).  2. Fixed Position Size: The bot will use a fixed position size in USDT (e.g., $100 per trade) for all trades, with no need to calculate position size per trade. You will set this amount once, and it will apply to all pairs.  3. Stop Loss(SL) and Take Profit(TP): MUST BE LIMIT ORDERS, set immediately after entry, even 10s delay is acceptable for this.  - The bot will automatically place stop loss (1% below entry) and take profit (2% above entry) orders after executing the trade  These SL and TP values will be adjustable, and will apply for all pairs.  4. Trailing Stop: Once the price reaches 80% of the TP (e.g., 1.6% for a 2% TP), the bot will move the stop loss to 0.8% profit to lock in gains.  5. option to change leverage settings: isolated/cross and leverage amount  6. bot will need hosting so i run it 24/7  7. option to listen to webhooks from up to 20 ticker
