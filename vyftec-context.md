If single technologies do not match but the broader technology branches match like with with web scraping / PHP then there is no discrepency and we can do it and the project aligns perfectly with our skills.  We can not mentionn every discipine of PHP but we will be able to handle all of them, in this way it behaves with all technologies we master.
