backends and dashboards
As a web agency, we accompany the entire execution phase of dashboards, CRM, and ERP systems. To tackle complex requirements, we rely on Laravel.

Laravel is highly versatile and we will be able to realize everything that is feasible. Technically it’s characterized by a programmer-friendly structure with a flat learning curve. As an open-source platform, it enables seamless integration into the wide spectrum of open-source software. By easily connecting to current technologies such as React, Node, SQL, plotly, and others, Laravel offers an effective solution. It guarantees the highest scalability and security and ranks among the leading frameworks on the market. Additionally, it benefits from an extensive developer community and well-documented eLearning resources, which expedite and simplify the development process. Laravel facilitates the implementation of cutting-edge security concepts, making it an ideal solution for demanding requirements and high adaptability.

support

We are available five days a week and 50 weeks a year to ensure continuous availability and support. If needed, we provide a dedicated team solely focused on maintaining your project. Various frameworks can be employed for monitoring and ensuring functionality during software expansion and updates, as described under “Testing and Monitoring.”

scalability

Laravel is considered the industry standard in PHP frameworks. It is designed for scalability and can be extended with technologies capable of efficient database management. Suitable for medium to very large systems with a high degree of adaptability, Laravel offers an effective solution. However, for smaller projects and widespread requirements, the suitability of conventional script and system solutions tailored to the specific application area should be considered.

security

Frameworks also serve to shift the responsibility for implementing security concepts from developers to software base systems. Developed and maintained by the community, these systems enable high security standards. Through regular software updates using packet managers such as Composer and npm and the consistent implementation of best practices during development, application security meets the current state of global open-source technology. Laravel’s leading position in the market enhances this security, as it undergoes more thorough testing than less widely used frameworks. As a result, such a software stack offers highest possible security at the software level.

Laufbahn in Kürze

Seit 2003 arbeite ich als Open Source Full Stack Webentwickler und Projektmanager. Dabei war ich 12 Jahre in Web Agenturen angestellt davon vier Jahre als Typo3 Entwickler. Etwa acht Jahre habe ich freiberuflich gearbeitet und war dabei oft in Backend und eCommerce Projekten tätig. Sechs Jahre war ich in die Umsetzung von CRM / ERP Systemen involviert.

Spezialisierung

Mein Fokus hat sich über die Jahre von Design zu Full Stack zu Backend zu Verwaltung verschoben. Ich habe diverse Erweiterungen entwickelt oft waren es Payment Gateway Anbindungen. Zum Kauf biete ich ein Gambio Modul für die Einbindung der Bitcoin Zahlungsweise an.

Freizeit, Trading und Finanzen

Seit einigen Jahren beschäftige ich mich mit Börsenhandel, Web 3.0 und Kryptos. Ich habe zwei automatisierte Handelssysteme für Risikoanlagen entwickelt, die gecopytradet werden können. In meiner Freizeit mache ich gerne Sport (Gym, Rennrad, Ausdauersport, Footminton und Yoga), reise um die Welt und besuche kulturell wichtige Veranstaltungen und Konzerte.

corporate websites with wordpress and redaxo
As a web agency, we specialize in implementing web projects using state-of-the-art AI-driven software.

With Redaxo as a Content Management System, we are able to implement high-quality fully responsive web presences quickly and cost-effectively. It allows for a very high degree of personalization with minimal programming effort, making it perfect for the current market environment. Please take a moment to look at the Redaxo reference projects. We will also be able to use other CMS platforms.

Everyone knows WordPress. It stands out due to its extensive community, user-friendly admin area, variety of plugins, and shallow learning curve. We typically use WordPress for smaller projects where frontend customization is more important than backend requirements.
