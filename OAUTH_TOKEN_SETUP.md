# Freelancer OAuth Token Setup Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your OAuth token `ndC54RcK7T5DwoKlYD6iBvQjai9SrK` is **expired or invalid**.

All authenticated API calls are returning:
```
401 UNAUTHORIZED - "You must be logged in to perform this request"
```

## ✅ What's Working
- ✅ Username resolution: `webskillssl` → User ID `3953491`
- ✅ Public API endpoints (user lookup)
- ✅ Code logic and bid formatting

## ❌ What's Not Working
- ❌ OAuth token authentication
- ❌ Bid submission API calls
- ❌ Private API endpoints

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Step 1: Go to Freelancer Developer Portal
1. Visit: https://developers.freelancer.com/
2. Log in with your **webskillssl** account credentials

### Step 2: Create or Access Your App
1. If you don't have an app yet:
   - Click "Create New App"
   - Name: "Bid Automation Tool" (or any name)
   - Description: "Automated bidding system"
   
2. If you already have an app:
   - Select your existing app from the dashboard

### Step 3: Generate OAuth Token
1. In your app dashboard, look for "OAuth Tokens" or "API Keys"
2. Click "Generate New Token" or "Create Token"
3. **IMPORTANT**: Select these scopes:
   - ✅ `basic` (required for user info)
   - ✅ `fln:project_manage` (required for bid submission)
4. Copy the generated token (it will be much longer than 30 characters)

### Step 4: Update Configuration
1. Open `config.py` file
2. Replace the old token:
```python
# OLD (expired)
FREELANCER_API_KEY = "ndC54RcK7T5DwoKlYD6iBvQjai9SrK"

# NEW (your fresh token)
FREELANCER_API_KEY = "your_new_long_oauth_token_here"
```

### Step 5: Test the New Token
Run the test script:
```bash
node debug-freelancer-token.js
```

You should see:
- ✅ Authentication successful
- ✅ User details retrieved
- ✅ All tests passing

### Step 6: Test Bid Submission
Once authentication works, test with:
```bash
node test-freelancer-api.js --no-bid
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Token Still Not Working?
1. **Check Token Length**: Valid tokens are usually 50-100+ characters
2. **Verify Scopes**: Must include `basic` and `fln:project_manage`
3. **Account Status**: Ensure your Freelancer account is in good standing
4. **Token Expiry**: Some tokens have expiration dates

### Common Token Formats
```
✅ Valid: "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6"
❌ Invalid: "ndC54RcK7T5DwoKlYD6iBvQjai9SrK" (too short)
```

### Still Having Issues?
1. Try generating a new app entirely
2. Contact Freelancer API support
3. Verify your account doesn't have API restrictions

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix
Once you have a valid token:
- ✅ Automatic bid submission will work
- ✅ All authentication errors will be resolved
- ✅ Green "Send Application" button will submit real bids
- ✅ API responses will show success instead of 401 errors

## 📞 Need Help?
If you continue having issues after following these steps, the problem might be:
1. Account-level restrictions
2. Freelancer API changes
3. Regional access limitations

The code is working correctly - it's purely an authentication token issue!
